    <h1>Welcome to my Basic Website</h1>
    <p1>This is a paragraph on my website. You are reading it now.</p1>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p1>I am a user. Yep.</p1>
    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p1>I'm not giving out my contact.</p1>    
    <h2>Don't You Think Headings Waste Space?</h2>
    <p1>I do. Just look at all that empty space. That's perfectly fine paper left blank for no reason. It matters less on a website because it's not real but in any other case it's eh.</p1>
